Assortion of my python projects

# DISCLAIMER
The "Run At Discretion" folder might only work on school computers, and the noconsole ones can only be stopped via task manager, but can run with just a double click.
Not my fault if you break your computer :/
The threading ones are 50x as worse as the normal ones, since there are 50 threads
